# Scores microservice

To keep track of the scores of my otherwise static [browser-based Tetris](https://emmanuelbosquet.com/tetris-vanilla/)

No database here, a simple `scores.txt` file will do the trick.

# Requirements

Have NodeJS installed, clone the repo, and do

```
npm install
nodemon index.js
```
